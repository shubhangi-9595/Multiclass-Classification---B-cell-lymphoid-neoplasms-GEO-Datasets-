Step 1 - Run "project_5_aml.Rmd" on RStudio. Make sure the packages readxl, DESeq2, data.table, tibble and GEOquery from Bioconductor are installed in RStudio. 

Step 2 - The "project_5_aml.Rmd" from the source folder will generate "combined_exp_matrix.csv", "metadata.txt", "Subtypes.csv", "Subtypes.csv" and "Differ_exp_genes_aml.csv" files through this step.

Step -3 Run "GSE183030.Rmd" on RStudio, Load "GO_Annotated.csv" file in it. "similar.csv" is generated from this code.

Step 2 - Load "Differ_exp_genes_aml.csv", "Subtypes1.csv", "Subtypes", "GO_Annotated.csv", "similar.csv" into the "assignment5.ipynb" file from the source folder and run the file.
